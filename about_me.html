                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Tim and I am based in Bristol, UK. </p> 
                </p>My career path started in the accounting and tax world. However it wasn't long before my interest in tech and how things work was clearly my preferred choice over accounting. I remained in the accounting profession but providing IT support to the business and colleagues.</p>
                <p>Having been largely self taught over the years in many differing areas of tech I decided it was time for some more structured training. This lead me to sign up for the <a href="https://nology.io/"> _nology</a> Software Developer training course.</p>
